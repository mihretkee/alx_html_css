# CSS Advanced Project

This project is part of the **HTML & CSS Advanced** curriculum at ALX.  
It focuses on implementing the CSS styles for a full webpage layout based on a Figma design. The HTML structure was already built in the previous task (HTML, advanced), and in this phase, we bring the design to life using CSS.
